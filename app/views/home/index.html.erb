        <p>If you do come across a pet in a locked vehicle this is how you can help:</p>
        ​
        <ol>
            <li>Take down the car's make, model and license-plate number.
            <li>If there are businesses nearby, notify their managers or security guards and ask them to make an announcement to find the car's owner.
            <li>If the owner can't be found, call the non-emergency number of the local police or animal control and wait by the car for them to arrive. In Florida we know have HB 131- (link) which allows Samaritans to legally remove animals from cars under
                certain circumstances.
        </ol>
