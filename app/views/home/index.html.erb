        <h2>Save a pet that has been left in a car</h2>

        <p>If you do come across a pet in a locked vehicle this is how you can help:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Take down the car's make, model and license-plate number.
          <li>If there are businesses nearby, notify their managers or security guards and ask them to make an announcement to find the car's owner.
          <li>If the owner can't be found, call the non-emergency number of the local police or animal control and wait by the car for them to arrive. In Florida we know have <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Committees/billsummaries/2016/html/1151">HB 131</a> which allows Samaritans to legally remove animals from cars under certain circumstances.

        <ol>
            <li>Check to see if the vehicle is locked.
            <li>You must have a reasonable belief that the animal is in imminent danger or suffering harm.
            <li>Ensure law enforcement is notified prior to entering vehicle or immediately thereafter.
            <li>Use no more force than is necessary.
            <li>Remain with the animal in a safe location until law enforcement arrives.

        <h3>What to look for</h3>

        <p>Look for signs of heat stressâ€”heavy panting, glazed eyes, a rapid pulse,
        unsteadiness, a staggering gait, vomiting, or a deep red or purple tongue.</p>

        <h3>What to do</h3>

        <p>Once you remove a pet that is overheated move him to a cooler area
        and take these emergency steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Gradually lower the pet's body temperature by applying cool (not cold)
            water all over their body or soaking them in a cool bath.

          <li>Place cool, wet towels over the back of the neck, in the armpits,
            and in the groin area. You may also wet the ear flaps and paws with
            cool water. Direct a fan on the wet areas to speed evaporative
            cooling.

          <li>You may offer fresh, cool water if your pet is alert and wants to
            drink. Do not force your pet to drink.
