  <h1>Heat stroke</h2>

  <h2>What to look for</h3>

  <p>Look for signs of heat stressâ€”heavy panting, glazed eyes, a rapid pulse,
  unsteadiness, a staggering gait, vomiting, or a deep red or purple tongue.</p>

  <h2>What to do</h3>

  <p>Once you remove a pet that is overheated move him to a cooler area
  and take these emergency steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Gradually lower the pet's body temperature by applying cool (not cold)
      water all over their body or soaking them in a cool bath.

    <li>Place cool, wet towels over the back of the neck, in the armpits,
      and in the groin area. You may also wet the ear flaps and paws with
      cool water. Direct a fan on the wet areas to speed evaporative
      cooling.

    <li>You may offer fresh, cool water if your pet is alert and wants to
      drink. Do not force your pet to drink.
