# Hot Dogs / Free Pets / etc.

This was a project for the first [Fort Lauderdale Civic
Hackathon](http://ftlcivichackathon.com) in July 2016.

The goal was to create an informational site about what normal people can do to
help animals that have been left in cars by their owners. This is something that
many of us in South Florida have been confronted with. We have an answer, and it
isn't "do nothing". :wink:

The site is deployed here:

We'd like to thank all the lovely people we met at the hackathon, but
especially the organizers of Code for Fort Lauderdale: Rob Davis, Ryan Gates,
and Quyen Tran.
